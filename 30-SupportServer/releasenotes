Version 0.1.2
-------------

Added funnctionality to restore the database during installation from S3 images
at s3://thirty-zero-devops bucket with names DATAFILENAME="docserver-data.ref01"
FILEFILENAME="docserver-file.ref01"

These files are read from S3 and imported during the set-up of the environment, so that
there is a working wp instance, filled with data, after stack creation!!
